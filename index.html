                        <p>Initially involved in analysis of an existing proprietary legacy application
                            and bid preparation prior to succesfully winning the contract for a functionally
                            equivalent replacement built on Open Source technologies. Tom&#39;s role
                            involved 2-week on-site pre-elaboration phase focussing on examination
                            of the existing codebase, code metrics, functional analysis Close working
                            with Business Analysts and Subject Matter Experts leading to requirements
                            gathering, discussions with the client&#39;s own Technical Architects,
                            and investigation into candidate technologies for the bid. Following the
                            pre-elaboration, Tom was then heavily involved in the proposal document
                            that formed the basis of the succesful bid. He produced key sections of
                            the document including comparison of web technologies and frameworks, database
                            systems and CMS. Following a successful bid, Tom was fundamental to the
                            Sprint Zero and Elaboration activities, setting up Git repositores, CI
                            build servers, project structure and the reference architecture. This role
                            required close teamwork with the Principal and Technical Architects to
                            refine and agree the project&#39;s code structure and key design patterns
                            around separation of tiers, REST APIs, database transactions and audit,
                            module structure and coding standards.
                            <p/>Currently Tom&#39;s role is as a technical lead and Scrum Master for an
                            end-to-end development team of 10 to 12 people including a Business Analyst,
                            Developers, Functional Testers and Automation Engineers. Tom&#39;s day-to-day
